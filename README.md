## What is this?

ðŸ”¥ flamethrower is an open source, high level, debugger that utilizes AI superpowers to draw context, offer suggestions, and iterate on those suggestions to accomplish a given task. Think a combination of GitHub Copilot's context-awareness in [KillianLucas' Open Source Open Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) shell.

## Demo

https://github.com/scottsus/flamethrower/assets/88414565/93195176-c124-4528-b3c2-500ce87cd494

## Quick Start

```
pip install flamethrower
```

### API Keys

There's no getting around the friction of configuring API keys

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
```

### Terminal

Navigate to your current workspace, and simply run `flamethrower`, or `ft` for the pros.

```
cd {UNBELIEVABLY_COMPLICATED_WORKSPACE}
flamethrower
```

### Example Usage

Use lowercase letters for commands you run in the shell, like `python main.py` or `node server.ts`

```
python main.py -> SOME_ERROR
Wtf???? ðŸ¤¬ # Literally type this in the terminal
```

An implementation run is initiated with a natural language query that begins with an `uppercase letter`.

## Motivation for ðŸ”¥ flamethrower

### GitHub Copilot

Closed source GitHub Copilot draws context very effectively, and `Quick Fix` is a neat feature that explains error from stdout logs if the last command returned a non-zero return code.

### Open Interpreter

The Open Interpreter, an open-source gem, specializes in crafting new code from the ground up. It's a favorite among data scientists and those needing sophisticated chart plotting, thanks to its iterative approach to achieving desired results.

### A Research Project?

ðŸ”¥ flamethrower combines the agency afforded by Large Action Models (LAM) with the workspace awareness of Copilot, allowing it to take context-specific suggestions and continue iteration until a successful outcome. ðŸ”¥ is workspace-first, and aims to serve software engineers in complex tasks that need a lot of context management.
