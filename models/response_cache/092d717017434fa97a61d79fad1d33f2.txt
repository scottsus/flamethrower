Here is a Java code snippet to print numbers from 1 to 99:

```java
public class Numbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 99; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

This code uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 99 (inclusive) and prints each number on a new line using `System.out.println()`.
