Here is a simple Java code that prints numbers from 1 to 98:

```java
public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 98; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the loop starts from 1 and goes up to 98. It uses a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers, and the `System.out.println()` statement is used to print each number on a new line.
