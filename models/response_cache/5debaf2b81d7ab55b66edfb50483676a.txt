Here, as an example, you will see ways to improve and declutter the mentioned "context/dir_walker.py" script.

Before Refactoring:
```python
import os

def dir_walker(root):
    dir_list = []
    file_list = []
    
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root):
        for dir in dirnames:
            dir_list.append(os.path.join(dirpath, dir))
        for file in filenames:
            file_list.append(os.path.join(dirpath, file))

    return dir_list, file_list
```

Refactored code:
```python
import os
from typing import Tuple, List

def dir_walker(root: str) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]:
    """Walk through directory and segregate files and directories.

    Parameters:
    root -- path to the directory to walk

    Returns:
    Tuple containing two lists -- list of directories and list of files.
    """
    
    dir_list, file_list = [], []
    
    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root):
        dir_list += [os.path.join(dirpath, dir) for dir in dirnames]
        file_list += [os.path.join(dirpath, file) for file in filenames]

    return dir_list, file_list
```

Here's what has been done:
1. Defined the type hinting at function definition to make code cleaner and easier to understand.
2. Used list comprehension for appending elements to list which is more Pythonic.
3. Added docstring to make the usage of the function clear.
4. Removed unnecessary intermediate variables, making the code more concise.
