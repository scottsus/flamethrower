Sure! Here's an example solution to the LeetCode Two Sum problem implemented in Python:

```
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Create a hash map to store the complement of each element
    complement_map = {}
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Check if the complement exists in the hash map
        if num in complement_map:
            # Return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target
            return [complement_map[num], i]
        else:
            # Calculate the complement of the current number and store it in the map
            complement_map[target - num] = i
    
    # Return an empty list if no solution is found
    return []
```

To test the function, you can call it with an array of numbers and a target value, like this:

```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(twoSum(nums, target))
```

This will output `[0, 1]`, which means that the numbers at indices 0 and 1 (2 and 7) add up to the target value of 9.
