Here is a Java program that prints numbers from 1 to 96:

```java
public class PrintNumbers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 96; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

When you run this program, it will output the numbers from 1 to 96, each on a separate line.
